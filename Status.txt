In Progress:

1.  Exempt mods and the broadcaster from the restriction for regulars (possible extend our Golang Twitch IRC to support more information from the user making the request)

Todo (not prioritized):

1.  Incorporate a Discord IRC to allow information read from the music player to be returned back to the user making the request on Twitch
2.  Implement a way to only allow a user three songs on the queue. (Make this configurarble by environment variable, this might also require us to select an open source music bot - already forked - to do this and allow an easier way to get #2 done)
3.  Update our music bot to allow song deletion based on queue position/name of song

Backlog (not prioritized): 

1.  Banter counter for discord
2.  !commands API (list, add, remove)
3.  React.js/Node.js Based GUI for easy manipulation and viewing
4.  Authentication for logging in
5.  OSRS GE command
6.  OSRS quest guide easy look-up
