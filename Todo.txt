1. Figure out how to integrate PhantomBot into discord. DONE
2. Figure out how to read logs from a file in real time from twitch. SOMEWHAT DONE 
    Got a shell script to post to discord
3. Figure out how to run a server to read from the text file and run the script to post to discord
    Got a shell script to continually poll the log and find the key word "!sr" and it invokes a shell script that makes a cURL call to discord which
    posts into general
4. Need to figure out how to parse the line in BASH properly
    - Also need to look into if there is a way to intercept the API call and get the JSON from there instead of reading a log file
    - Need to change readlogfile.sh to read the log file location from the command line
